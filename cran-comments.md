## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

1. To address the note, I edited the LICENSE file to include only two lines, the first for the year, and the second for the copyright holder.

2. To address the warning, I changed the bitwise OR operator | to the logical OR operator || in fix_qiime2_domain_C.cpp.

3. Changed the version from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 to reflect these changes.
