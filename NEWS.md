* `import_qiime2_tax_table()` now correctly parses the Taxon field into ranks irregardless of whether the ranks are separated by a semicolon plus a space or only a semicolon.

* Fixed a bug in `import_qiime2_tax_table()` which caused the second and last lines of the resulting tax_table to be identical.

# speedytax 1.0.3

* Initial CRAN submission.
